MauiOSM

This project was made with this following tools:

1. [Mapsui](https://mapsui.com/documentation/home.html) a C# map component that can be used to access OpenStreetMap tile services throught BruTile.
2. [Itinero](https://docs.itinero.tech/docs/itinero/index.html) a routing project for . NET/Mono to calculate routes in a road network

This sample is configured to generate routes for Portugal. If you want to do it with another country, you need to change the ".routerdb" file in the "Itinero.API/data" folder as indicated in the Itinero project [documentation](https://docs.itinero.tech/docs/itinero/routing-api.html).

Make sure the Itinero.API is running to test the routes in the Maui application.

Enjoy!!!
